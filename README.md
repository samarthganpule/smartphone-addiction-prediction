# Smartphone Usage Behavioral Analysis & Addiction Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes smartphone usage data to predict user addiction based on daily activity patterns. It demonstrates the full data science workflowâ€”data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and result interpretation.

## Dataset
- Source: [Your data source or link]
- Features: Age, Gender, Total_App_Usage_Hours, Daily_Screen_Time_Hours, Number_of_Apps_Used, Social_Media_Usage_Hours, Productivity_App_Usage_Hours, Gaming_App_Usage_Hours, Location

## Workflow
1. **basic.py**: Loads raw data, cleans missing values/duplicates, and stores cleaned data.
2. **EDA.py**: Explores feature distributions, correlations, and user demographics.
3. **model.py**: Builds and evaluates a Random Forest classifier for smartphone addiction, based on selected features.

## How to Run
1. Run `basic.py` to clean the dataset.
2. Run `EDA.py` for data exploration and visualization.
3. Run `model.py` to build, train, and evaluate the predictive model.
